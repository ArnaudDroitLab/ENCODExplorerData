ENCODExplorerData: A compilation of metadata from ENCODE

"The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Consortium is an international 
collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research 
Institute (NHGRI). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of 
functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the 
protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and 
circumstances in which a gene is active"^[source : [ENCODE Projet Portal ](https://www.encodeproject.org/)] .

This package has been designed to facilitate data access by compiling the 
metadata associated with ENCODE files and making it available in the format
of a data table. While this data can be accessed as-is, we recommend using
the ENCODExplorer companion package, which contains utility functions
for using the online ENCODE search function, downloading selected files,
and retrieving control-treatment experimental designs from ENCODE.

To generate up-to-date version of the data tables exported by this package,
simply run the `inst/scripts/make-data.R` script.
